# Triangle-Trading-Strategy

This project was inspired from research that I did as an intern. Given, the idea's similarity to what I developed at work, I've only shared a script that generates a market database of OHLC data for the S&P 500. As for the ConvNet that I used to trade, I don't feel comfortable publicly sharing the code. If you're interested, please reach out and we can talk more in depth.
